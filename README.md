# DAYREC
DAYREC was created to solve a simple problem. 

We designed an application so that we could submit bets on how many times the screen isn’t shared or how many times the session isn’t recorded.

With this, not only can you roll the dice on whether or not a recording is created. You can also have some fun with it too!

### Introduction:
DAYREC is a full-stack web application built on Node.JS, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, and Swagger, with a mySQL-based database.

Technologies used within Node.JS include but are not limited to:  bcryptjs, chartjs,  express, express-handlebars, mysql2, passport, sequelize.
